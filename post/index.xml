You get up every morning
From your ‘larm clock’s warning
Take the 8:15 into the city
There’s a whistle up above
And people pushin’, people shovin’
And the girls who try to look pretty
And if your train’s on time
You can get to work by nine
And start your slaving job to get your pay
If you ever get annoyed
Look at me I’m self-employed
I love to work at nothing all day</description></item><item><title>Billy Carson Net Worth</title><link>/billy-carson-net-worth.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>youremail@domain.com (Some Person)</author><guid>/billy-carson-net-worth.html</guid><description>﻿Billy Carson net worth is

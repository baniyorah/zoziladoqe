However, the singer failed to mention her husband T.I in her celebration posts, after the man shared a controversial anti-marriage piece.</p><p class=dh>The Xscape singer is known for being a woman dedicated to her family, including her parents, kids, and siblings. On Father’s Day, Tiny remembered her late father with a heartfelt message in her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/majorgirl/>Instagram</a> account, where she shared a photo from her childhood next to the man that gave her life.</p><p class=dh>She wrote a touching message in her post saying:</p><p class=dh>“One of my favorite pictures of my Favorite Guy & I.. Happy Father’s Day to the most amazing dad I coulda ever wished for! He’s the man responsible for molding me into who I am musically & morally today!! Thankful for every day, year I got to spend with him. May he Rest In Heaven!! #DaddysBabygirl” [sic]</p><p class=dh>Fans took the comment section to praise Tiny saying how adorable she was, and some even mentioned her father resembles her eldest son by a lot. Others took the chance to advise the singer to leave her husband and move on with her life.</p><p class=dh>The comments come from the fact that many people believe T.I won’t ever change his cheating ways and Tiny deserves better. The rapper was recently caught on video slapping an unknown woman on the booty before his concert in Atlanta. The lady then seated comfortably at his side with a hand on his thigh.</p><p class=dh>And as if that wasn’t enough, T.I recently shared a controversial anti-marriage post to his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/troubleman31/>Instagram</a>, sharing an extract from a 2015 Fox News opinion piece written by Suzanne Venker. In the article, Venker mentions some of the reasons why the modern man doesn’t want to be legally tied to a woman forever.</p><p class=dh>“’Men know there’s a good chance they’ll lose their friends, their respect, their space, their sex life, their money and — if it all goes wrong — their family,’ says Helen Smith, Ph.D., author of ‘Men on Strike.’ ‘They don’t want to enter into a legal contract with someone who could effectively take half their savings, pension and property when the honeymoon period is over. Men aren’t wimping out by staying unmarried or being commitment-phobes. They’re being smart,” says the post.</p><p class=dh>T.I also offered his opinion on the piece, writing in his caption:</p><p class=dh>“Note to women: Happiness needs no validation….The Ego does. Most women out there nowadays just wanna be married to impress they friends, family (his side pieces) and fit into society’s standards. THAT’S NOT LOVE!!! That’s how you end up stuck with someone YOU THOUGHT YOU WANTED!!!!” [sic]</p><p class=dh>Tiny’s reaction to her husbands’ post was to share a video of Snoop Dogg talking about his wife, stating how he would be a mess if he hadn’t married, and praising other rappers in the game that have strong women in their lives who can offer them stability.</p><p class=dh>She shaded T.I’s post by writing a clear message for him in her caption that says:</p><p class=dh>“Crown the KING who knows that his QUEEN is the most important piece on the board. #chessnotcheckers #CHECKMATE”</p><p class=dh>Is clear that the couple is going through a rough patch once again. It has been just a few months since Tiny called off the divorce proceedings that she started in late 2016 after she admitted they were working on fixing their relationship. Perhaps she would want to reconsider her decision.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jnFvcWplYsGquthmqqGZoprAbsDHq6awmpGYuG68yJxkpZmkmnqnrdOhnKtllpp7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f88825-tiny-shares-throwback-pic-late-father-fe-html.html&text=Tiny%20shares%20throwback%20pic%20with%20late%20father%20after%20feud%20with%20T.I.%20over%20his%20anti-marriage%20post&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f88825-tiny-shares-throwback-pic-late-father-fe-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f88825-tiny-shares-throwback-pic-late-father-fe-html.html&title=Tiny%20shares%20throwback%20pic%20with%20late%20father%20after%20feud%20with%20T.I.%20over%20his%20anti-marriage%20post" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f88825-tiny-shares-throwback-pic-late-father-fe-html.html&title=Tiny%20shares%20throwback%20pic%20with%20late%20father%20after%20feud%20with%20T.I.%20over%20his%20anti-marriage%20post" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f88825-tiny-shares-throwback-pic-late-father-fe-html.html&title=Tiny%20shares%20throwback%20pic%20with%20late%20father%20after%20feud%20with%20T.I.%20over%20his%20anti-marriage%20post" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f88825-tiny-shares-throwback-pic-late-father-fe-html.html&description=Tiny%20shares%20throwback%20pic%20with%20late%20father%20after%20feud%20with%20T.I.%20over%20his%20anti-marriage%20post" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-was-gunga-din-filmed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where was Gunga Din Filmed?

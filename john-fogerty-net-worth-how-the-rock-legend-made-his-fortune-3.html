He is best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter of Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), the band that dominated the charts in the late 1960s and early 1970s with hits like “Proud Mary”, “Bad Moon Rising”, “Fortunate Son”, and “Have You Ever Seen the Rain”. He is also a successful solo artist, with albums like Centerfield, Revival, and Wrote a Song for Everyone. But how much is John Fogerty worth, and how did he earn his wealth? Here are some facts and figures about his music career and net worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Early Life and Career</strong></h2><p>John Fogerty was born on May 28, 1945, in Berkeley, California. He grew up in El Cerrito, California, where he formed his first band, the Blue Velvets, with his classmates Stu Cook and Doug Clifford. His brother Tom later joined the group, which changed its name to the Golliwogs in 1964. The band signed with Fantasy Records, a label that mainly focused on jazz music.</p><p>In 1966, Fogerty was drafted into the army and served as a supply clerk for a year. After he was discharged in 1967, he renamed the band Creedence Clearwater Revival, inspired by a friend’s name, a beer commercial, and a reference to their musical style. He also became the band’s leader, writing most of the songs, singing lead vocals, and playing lead guitar.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>CCR’s Success and Breakup</strong></h2><p>CCR quickly rose to fame with their distinctive blend of rock, country, blues, and swamp pop. They released seven albums between 1968 and 1972, selling over 30 million copies worldwide. They had nine top-ten singles in the US, including five number-two hits. They also performed at major festivals like Woodstock and Monterey Pop.</p><p>However, CCR also faced many challenges and conflicts. They had a bitter relationship with their label Fantasy Records, which owned the rights to their songs and took a large share of their royalties. They also had internal disputes over creative control and artistic direction. Tom Fogerty left the band in 1971, and the remaining members split up in 1972.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Solo Career and Legal Battles</strong></h2><p>After CCR’s breakup, Fogerty embarked on a solo career. He released an album of country covers under the name The Blue Ridge Rangers in 1973, followed by a self-titled album in 1975. However, he then went into a long hiatus due to legal issues with Fantasy Records and its owner Saul Zaentz.</p><p>Zaentz sued Fogerty for breach of contract, claiming that he owed him more albums. He also sued him for plagiarism, alleging that Fogerty’s solo hit “The Old Man Down the Road” copied CCR’s “Run Through the Jungle”. Fogerty countersued Zaentz for defamation and unfair business practices. The lawsuits lasted for years and cost millions of dollars in legal fees.</p><p>Fogerty eventually won both cases, but he was so traumatized by the ordeal that he refused to play any CCR songs for a long time. He also declined to perform with his former bandmates when they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Comeback and Legacy</strong></h2><p>Fogerty made a comeback in 1985 with his album Centerfield, which topped the charts and spawned three hit singles: “The Old Man Down the Road”, “Rock and Roll Girls”, and “Centerfield”. He followed it with Eye of the Zombie in 1986, but then took another break from music until 1997.</p><p>In 1997, he released Blue Moon Swamp, which won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Album. He also started playing CCR songs again in his concerts, after reconciling with his former label Fantasy Records. He released several more albums in the 2000s and 2010s, including Deja Vu All Over Again (2004), Revival (2007), Wrote a Song for Everyone (2013), and Fogerty’s Factory (2020).</p><p>Fogerty is widely regarded as one of the greatest rock songwriters and singers of all time. He has influenced many artists across genres, such as Bruce Springsteen, Tom Petty, Bob Seger, John Mellencamp, Dave Grohl, Keith Urban, Miranda Lambert, and Brad Paisley. He has received many honors and awards for his music career, such as:</p><ul><li>The BMI Icon Award (2005)</li><li>The Americana Music Association Lifetime Achievement Award for Songwriting (2009)</li><li>The National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences President’s Merit Award (2010)</li><li>The ASCAP Founders Award (2012)</li><li>The Swedish Polar Music Prize (2019)</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>John Fogerty Net Worth</strong></h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, John Fogerty’s net worth is estimated to be $90 million as of 2021. He earned most of his fortune from his music sales, concerts, and royalties. He also owns a real estate portfolio worth about $30 million, which includes properties in California, Nevada, and Canada.</p><p>Fogerty is still active in the music industry, releasing new albums and performing live. He also supports various charitable causes, such as veterans’ organizations, environmental groups, and children’s foundations. He is married to Julie Kramer since 1991, and they have four children together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7Jfn7ypuoyfpqCdoqnGbrrErWSwp6KptW60zrBkraCVYr%2Bwr8pmo56flaOxbrnAnZxmoJmoeqe70a2sp51daHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjohn-fogerty-net-worth-how-the-rock-legend-made-his-fortune-3.html&text=John%20Fogerty%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Rock%20Legend%20Made%20His%20Fortune&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjohn-fogerty-net-worth-how-the-rock-legend-made-his-fortune-3.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-fogerty-net-worth-how-the-rock-legend-made-his-fortune-3.html&title=John%20Fogerty%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Rock%20Legend%20Made%20His%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjohn-fogerty-net-worth-how-the-rock-legend-made-his-fortune-3.html&title=John%20Fogerty%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Rock%20Legend%20Made%20His%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjohn-fogerty-net-worth-how-the-rock-legend-made-his-fortune-3.html&title=John%20Fogerty%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Rock%20Legend%20Made%20His%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjohn-fogerty-net-worth-how-the-rock-legend-made-his-fortune-3.html&description=John%20Fogerty%20Net%20Worth%3a%20How%20the%20Rock%20Legend%20Made%20His%20Fortune" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lebron-james-wife-savannah-beetlejuice-halloween-costumes-2023-8383864.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="LeBron James and Wife Savannah Show Off 'Beetlejuice' Costumes: 'Showtime!'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ryan-blaney.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is NASCAR Driver Ryan Blaney Dating Someone in 2020?

When his older cousin, Mars, who is a rapper known as MarsRaps, moved in to live with his family, MattyB started to rap to his lyrics. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr>MattyB, age 15, persisted his cousin to help him with his own rap and it was when he reached the age of 7, the two made a YouTube video covering Justin Bieber’s song, Eenie Meenie&nbsp;in 2010. It gathered more than 500k views in a single week which was the first step for MattyB to reach fame. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>In 2012, his song, That’s the Way reached 11th spot on the Billboard ‘Social 50 Chart’ which heightened the number of his fans.

List Goes On Long</strong></h2><p dir=ltr>When it comes to MattyB’s girlfriends, the list isn’t quite short. The first time that he opened up about having a girlfriend was when he was dating YouTube personality, Joelle Joanie aka JoJo Siwa. But the relationship didn’t last long, and he was soon rumored to be dating internet star, CeCe after they made a video together.</p><p dir=ltr>But it only turned out to be a rumor that got dispelled when MattyB started dating pageant model Kate Cadogan in June 2013 after she played the love interest in two of his song-videos, Hooked on You and Ms. Jackson.</p><p dir=ltr>They met when MattyB played baseball with Kate’s twin brother Jack and didn’t waste any time to ride the rollercoaster of their romance. But their ride was a short one as they consequently split after a year. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>Then came the turn of Gracie Haschak to take a plunge in the rumors of being MattyB’s girlfriend. It was after she appeared in his cover music video of My Humps with her sisters in March 2015. Then again, it was just a meek rumor that didn’t last for much longer.</p><p dir=ltr>Because in 2017 MattyB and his then ex-girlfriend, Kate continued their romantic rollercoaster and have been going strong ever since.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>You Don't Want To Miss:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Adam Conover In Love With Wife-Like Girlfriend & Gay!

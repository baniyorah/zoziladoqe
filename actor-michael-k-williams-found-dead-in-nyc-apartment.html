It was unclear how long the actor may have been dead.</p><p>“No foul play indicated,’’ a police source said. “No forced entry, the apartment was in order.’’</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Friends, family and police mourn the death of the actor. <span class=credit>James Messerschmidt</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Someone believed to be a friend outside of Michael K.

As a black man growing up in the ’hood, I bear witness to some of those events.”</p><p>He even had the scar to prove it — the remnant of a <a href=#>horrific slashing from a fight outside a bar</a> in Queens when he was 25.</p><p>Williams credited the facial scar with landing him his first big acting breaks, which revolved around “thug roles.’’</p><p>The actor had been vocal about his own struggles with drugs through the years, too, including during the filming of “The Wire,’’ saying that getting so into the role of Little, who robs drug dealers, affected him in real life.</p><p>The&nbsp;actor <a href=#>told NPR in 2016</a>&nbsp;that he once stumbled into a church in New Jersey, desperately seeking help for his addiction.</p><p>“When I came through those doors, I was broken. … This was, I would say, around the … third season of ‘The Wire,’” Williams said.</p><span class=screen-reader-text>Previous</span><p><span>1</span> of <span>5</span></p><span class=screen-reader-text>Next</span><p

even heard of ‘The Wire,’ much less watched it,’’ he said, referring to the pastor.</p><p>“I wrote my full name down — Michael Kenneth Williams — and in the office, [the pastor] turns around, and he says, ‘So what do you want to be called, man?’ I said, ‘Well, you know, my name is Michael, but I could do Mike.’ He says, ‘Why does everybody say, “Omar, Omar’s in trouble”?’ And I was like, ‘Oh, this dude is clueless [about the show],’” Williams said.</p><p>The actor started out as a back-up dancer for Madonna and George Michael before being encouraged by rapper Tupac Shakur to go into performing.</p><p>He used his eventual fame to promote social justice, becoming an “ambassador for ending mass incarceration’’ for the American Civil Liberties Union in 2015.</p><p>“I could have been Eric Garner.&nbsp;I could have been Michael Brown or Trayvon Martin,’’ Williams told&nbsp;the&nbsp;Guardian, referring to three dead black men whose law enforcement-related fatalities&nbsp;helped fuel the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>“My goal is to end mass incarceration and to have more dialogue about how can we stop the government filling up jails with low-level, non-violent drug offenders and people with mental illnesses or addictions,” Williams said. “Those are health issues, not criminal.”</p><p class=postsid

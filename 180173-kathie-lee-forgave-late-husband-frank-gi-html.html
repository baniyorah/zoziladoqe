She also labeled her marriage as a “disappointment” for both of them.</p><p class=dh>Although things were uncomfortable from the very beginning, they were supposed to be married for life, so they stayed in their “illusion,” as Kathie described it, for six years before they eventually decided to part ways.</p><p class=dh>The singer found love again in the professional football player and TV sports commentator <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2015/08/09/when-frank-met-kathie-lee-the-story-of-the-giffords-marriage/?utm_term=.cf85761d8e8f">Frank Gifford</a>. They tied the knot in October 1986 and stayed together until he passed away in 2015.</p><p class=dh>When their romance hit the spotlight, the aspect that surprised people the most was their huge age gap.

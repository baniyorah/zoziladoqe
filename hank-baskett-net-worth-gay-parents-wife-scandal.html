He played for the Lobos from 2002 to 2005, earning a reputation as a reliable wide receiver and a team player. His college career culminated in 2005 when he was named to the All-Mountain West Conference team.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hank_Baskett_Career></span>Hank Baskett Career&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Baskett’s professional football career began in 2006 when he was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round of the NFL Draft.</p><p>He spent two seasons with the Eagles before being traded to the Indianapolis Colts in 2008. After one season with the Colts, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings in 2009. His NFL career was cut short in 2010 when he was released by the Vikings.</p><p>In addition to his NFL earnings, Baskett has ventured into other sources of income.

Their relationship quickly became the focus of media attention, and their lives were chronicled on the reality show “Kendra on Top.” The couple welcomed two children together, Hank Jr. and Alijah.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hank_Baskett_Gay></span>Hank Baskett Gay <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Media interest and conjecture have centered on Hank Baskett’s sexual orientation.

Baskett was accused of having an affair with transgender model Ava Sabrina London while his wife, Kendra Wilkinson, was eight months pregnant with their second child.</p><p>London stated that Baskett had given her $500 for adult services and that they had first met at a pub. After initially refuting the accusations, Baskett eventually acknowledged the incident, stating that his drug use at the time had left him in a condition of “confusion and despair”.</p><p>The controversy severely strained Baskett’s marriage and sparked a media frenzy. Understandably devastated by the betrayal, Wilkinson and his partner temporarily parted ways.</p><p>But in the end, they made the decision to resolve their differences and keep their union intact. In addition to publicly apologizing for his behavior, Baskett sought addiction treatment.</p><p>The pair went on the reality TV program “Marriage Boot Camp” in order to work through their marital issues, and they came out of the experience stronger than before.</p><p>Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett attending a marriage boot camp<br>Hank Baskett had a dark phase in his life, no doubt, but the incident also acted as a wake-up call. Since then, he has made a lot of adjustments in his life, putting his family, health, and profession first.</p><p>Along with continuing to work in the entertainment business, participating on a number of reality TV shows, and pursuing other interests, he has remained a devoted husband and father.</p><p>Even though the incident rocked Baskett to his core, he showed resiliency and a determination to grow from his mistakes.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hank_Baskett_Net_Worth_Age_Birthday_and_Hank_Baskett_Bio></span>Hank Baskett Net Worth, Age, Birthday, and Hank Baskett Bio<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Hank Aaron Baskett</td></tr><tr><td>Nickname</td><td>Hank</td></tr><tr><td>Gender</td><td>Male</td></tr><tr><td>Date of Birth</td><td>September 4, 1982</td></tr><tr><td>Hank Baskett Age</td><td>42 years old</td></tr><tr><td>Birthplace</td><td>Clovis, New Mexico, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Hank Baskett Parents Names</td><td>Hank Sr. and Linda Baskett</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6 ft 2 in (1.88 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>210 lb (95 kg)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Dark brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>One sister</td></tr><tr><td>Languages</td><td>English</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christian</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Zodiac</td><td>Virgo</td></tr><tr><td>Boyfriend/Girlfriend</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Married</td></tr><tr><td>Hank Baskett Wife Name</td><td>Kendra Wilkinson</td></tr><tr><td>Children’s Names</td><td>Hank Jr. and Alijah</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Former NFL wide receiver, reality TV star</td></tr><tr><td>Hank Baskett Net Worth</td><td>Estimated to be around $2 million</td></tr></tbody></table>Hank Baskett Net Worth</figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Hank Baskett As A Public Figure&nbsp;– Social Media Influencer</h3><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Social Media Site</strong></td><td><strong>Linked Destination</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hank Baskett Facebook</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Hank Baskett Instagram</td><td><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/hank_baskett/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Click Here</a></td></tr><tr><td>Hank Baskett Twitter</td><td><a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://twitter.com/TheHankBaskett rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Click Here</a></td></tr></tbody></table>Hank Baskett Net Worth Social Media Accounts</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hank_Baskett_Net_Worth></span>Hank Baskett Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Hank Baskett net worth is estimated to be around $2 million.

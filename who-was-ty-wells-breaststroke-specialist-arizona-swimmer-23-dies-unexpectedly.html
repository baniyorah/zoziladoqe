Ian Ingram, who is organizing the fundraiser, wrote, “Our Arizona Wildcat swimming family was devastated at the sudden passing of one of our most adored swimmers this past Friday. He was a guiding light to all of his friends and teammates as well as to all of us parents. He brought out the best in all of us and cared so deeply for all of his friends. His spirit was contagious, his smile lit up a room and he was a big brother to so many.” He concluded by adding: “He was an incredible young man who left his mark on all of us. He will be remembered by all of us with love in our hearts, FOREVER!! We are all better for knowing this beautiful young man.”</p><h2 class=split>Who was Ty Wells?</h2><p>Wells was a native of Manteca, California.

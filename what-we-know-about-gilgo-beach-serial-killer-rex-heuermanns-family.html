I will not be saying anything,” she told Newsday, which did not confirm her name but said she told court personnel she was Heuermann’s wife.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>EX-WIFE</h2><p>Heuermann was just 26 when he first married in New Brunswick, New Jersey, according to a 1990 wedding announcement showing him smiling in spectacles in his wedding snap.</p><p>His first wife, Elizabeth Ryan, was described as a “graduate of St. Peter’s High School” also in New Brunswick as well as Montclair State College, where she got a degree in business administration.</p><p>At the time she was a junior planner at a New Jersey office supplies company.</p><p>Heuermann was just an intern at an architecture company at the time, four years before he started his own firm. His brother, Craig, was his best man.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Victoria Heuermann, 26, was seen in this pic on her dad’s company website until Friday, when news broke of his arrest. <span class=credit>rh-architecture.com</span></figure><p>It was not immediately clear when that marriage ended — or why — and attempts to reach Ryan were unsuccessful Friday.</p><p>However, she has lived at her current home for around 15 years, according to neighbors there who told The Post she has been split from Heuermann for at least that long.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>DAUGHTER</h2><p>Heuermann’s 26-year-old daughter Victoria was proudly listed as just four key members of his “team” on his company website Friday — until it got yanked soon after The Post identified him as the suspect.</p><p>The daughter was pictured grinning in sunglasses, without getting a specific title.</p><p>It appears to have been a relatively new gig, however, with her LinkedIn describing her as a “sales associate” at Macy’s until a few years ago.</p><p>She worked at the Manhattan megastore while studying at the New York Institute of Technology, where she recently graduated with a BFA in Fine Arts in 2019, her profile said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Heuermann’s daughter, bottom right, was among just four members of the “team” listed on his company site. <span class=credit>rh-architecture.com</span></figure><p>“I know 3D/2D Animation, Modeling, Sculpting, Autodesk Maya/Mudbox, ZBrush, ToonBoom Harmony, Photoshop, Illustrator, and editing in After Effects and Premier,” she wrote — saying she was “looking for a job in animation,” rather than her dad’s architectural business.</p><p>Attempts to reach her were not immediately successful Friday, and the company she worked at with her dad did not respond to messages seeking comment.</p><p>“She’s very shy,” said DeVilliers, the next-door neighbor.</p><p>“A very nice girl.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>SPECIAL NEEDS SON</h2><p>Neighbors saw less of Heuermann’s son, whom some sources suggested was his stepson.</p><p>“He has a partially disabled kid. A very nice kid,” DeVilliers said of the boy, who does not appear to be listed on the property records.</p><p>“We spoke frequently, every day. And his kid is a nice kid, a special needs kid,” DeVilliers<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> also told CBS News</a>.</p><p>“The guy’s been quiet. Never really bothers anybody. We are kind of shocked.”</p><h2 class=block-info-box__heading>Who is Gilgo Beach serial killer suspect Rex Heuermann?</h2><p>A suspected serial killer <a href=#>has been arrested over the notorious Gilgo Beach murders</a> in Long Island, The Post can confirm.</p><p>Rex Heuermann, 59, a married dad of two and architect at a New York City firm, has a home on 1st Avenue in Massapequa Park, sources told The Post.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Rex Heuermann, a Long Island architect who was charged July 14, 2023, with murder in the deaths of three of the 11 victims in a long-unsolved string of killings known as the Gilgo Beach murders. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>His arrest is tied to the “Gilgo Four,” four women — Melissa Barthelemy, 24, Megan Waterman, 22, Amber Lynn Costello, 27, and Maureen Brainard-Barnes, 25 — found wrapped in burlap within days of each other in 2010.&nbsp;</p><p>The body of Barthelemy was first found along Ocean Parkway on Dec. 11, 2010, sparking fears of a serial killer in the area.</p><p>By spring 2011, the number of bodies had climbed to 10, including eight women as well as an unidentified man and toddler.</p><p>Heuermann’s arrest comes after Suffolk County’s new police commissioner created a special Gilgo Beach Homicide Investigation Task Force in February 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>PARENTS</h2><p>Heuermann proudly claimed that his dad, Theo, had been an “aerospace engineer who built satellites” — while also working as a cabinet maker.</p><p>He passed on that skill to the suspect, who said he still makes furniture — and learned to always rely on “a hammer” when he needs to “persuade something.”</p><p>Records show Theo Heuermann died in 1975, when he was 50 and his son would have been just 11.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The suspect bought the house he has always lived in from his mom in 1994, the year he started his own firm. <span class=credit>AP</span></figure><p>His mother, Dolores, appears to still be alive, according to records, which suggest she is 93.</p><p>She sold the 1st Avenue home she raised her family in to Heuermann in 1994, the year the US suffered the so-called Great Bond Massacre financial crisis.</p><p>Heuermann later confirmed that the recession spurred his decision to open his own firm helping companies with NYC’s building department.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmamxfrLWiwIywnGajnqTEbq3BqKytZZeeuai7jJucmpuYYsCmvsiao2ajmaG5pr6Mq5yxZZiawqa%2BzJqlp6tdm66utcuyZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-gilgo-beach-serial-killer-rex-heuermanns-family.html&text=What%20we%20know%20about%20Gilgo%20Beach%20suspected%20serial%20killer%20Rex%20Heuermann%27s%20family&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-we-know-about-gilgo-beach-serial-killer-rex-heuermanns-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-gilgo-beach-serial-killer-rex-heuermanns-family.html&title=What%20we%20know%20about%20Gilgo%20Beach%20suspected%20serial%20killer%20Rex%20Heuermann%27s%20family" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-gilgo-beach-serial-killer-rex-heuermanns-family.html&title=What%20we%20know%20about%20Gilgo%20Beach%20suspected%20serial%20killer%20Rex%20Heuermann%27s%20family" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-gilgo-beach-serial-killer-rex-heuermanns-family.html&title=What%20we%20know%20about%20Gilgo%20Beach%20suspected%20serial%20killer%20Rex%20Heuermann%27s%20family" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-we-know-about-gilgo-beach-serial-killer-rex-heuermanns-family.html&description=What%20we%20know%20about%20Gilgo%20Beach%20suspected%20serial%20killer%20Rex%20Heuermann%27s%20family" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./where-was-the-challenge-usa-season-2-filmed-cbs-show-will-unfold-at-the-crossroads-of-central-and-southeast-europe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Where was 'The Challenge: USA' Season 2 filmed?

The shootings took place at the Just-In-Time Recreation bowling alley and the Schemengees Bar and Grill on the night of October 25. Authorities are actively searching for the suspect and investigating the motive behind these horrific acts.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Family_Speaks_Out></span>Family Speaks Out<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The family of Robert Card has come forward to share their perspective on the tragic events. Katie Card, who is married to Robert’s brother, spoke to The Daily Beast about her brother-in-law’s mental health struggles. She described Robert as a loving, hardworking, and kind person, but mentioned that he had experienced an acute episode of mental health in the past year. According to Katie, Robert had recently started wearing powerful hearing aids to combat hearing loss and began claiming that he could hear people abusing him. The family has been in contact with Robert, urging him to turn himself in to the authorities.</p><p>Advertisement</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mental_Health_Issues></span>Mental Health Issues<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Katie Card revealed that her brother-in-law’s mental health had been deteriorating in recent months. He would get upset when his family tried to reassure him that the voices he heard were not real. Robert had even spent several weeks in a facility over the summer to address his mental health issues. Katie emphasized that the family had been supportive and understanding, but they were shocked and devastated when they heard about the shootings and the locations involved. She expressed hope that Robert would reflect on his actions and reach out to do the right thing. It is clear that mental health played a significant role in this tragic event, highlighting the importance of addressing and supporting individuals struggling with mental health challenges.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Details_of_the_Suspect></span>Details of the Suspect<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As authorities continue their search for Robert Card, more details about the suspect have emerged.

According to his family, Card recently began wearing powerful hearing aids to address his hearing impairment. However, instead of providing relief, these aids seemed to exacerbate his condition. Card started claiming that he could hear people abusing him, even at the locations where the shootings occurred. These delusions may have played a significant role in his actions, as he believed he was responding to real threats.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Previous_Mental_Health_Treatment></span>Previous Mental Health Treatment<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Card’s family has revealed that he had been grappling with mental health issues for some time. In the past year, he experienced an acute episode that significantly impacted his well-being. As a result, he sought treatment and spent several weeks in a facility over the summer. Despite the family’s efforts to support him, Card’s mental health continued to decline in recent months. This tragic event underscores the importance of providing adequate mental health resources and support to individuals in need.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Shootings></span>The Shootings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The double mass shootings that occurred in Maine have left the community in shock and mourning.

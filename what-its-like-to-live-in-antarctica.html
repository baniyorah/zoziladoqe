But have you ever wondered what it would be like to actually live there?</p><p>While there is no native population on Antarctica, there are 40 permanent research stations, with an average of 1,000 people living there year-round (around 25 people per station), braving harsh winds and an inhuman cold that once, in July 1983, dipped below 128 degrees Fahrenheit. All in the name of science.</p><p>This time of year — our summer, their winter — there is sunlight for only three hours a day, and it’s like being on the moon, and just as isolated.</p><p>As Antarctica is so difficult to get to, once you arrive, you can’t leave — until the next ship/airdrop comes six to eight months later. You are completely isolated from February to October, when the cold and the dark make flights too dangerous to attempt.</p><p>So what do you do? What happens if you’re stuck in a station for a year with really annoying people or a crazy sociopath? What does one do for fun in 21 hours of darkness? And how do you deal with such extreme cold ... or boredom?</p><p>I’ve always wondered about these things, and I got really excited when I found out my friend Tony Donaldson was doing a one-year stint as a field training officer at the Australian Antarctic Division, Mawson Station, in East Antarctica. I met Tony in 2014 during the Afghan Ski Challenge in Bamyan, Afghanistan (he was a ski instructor and avalanche prevention guide for locals in Bamyan, I was ... not).</p><p>I got even more excited when he agreed to answer my many and sometimes nonsensical questions to satisfy all of our curiosity. Enjoy!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/winter1.jpg><p>[Note: this interview was conducted via e-mail and Facebook over two months during the infrequent times when Tony had his spotty internet available, so it may not flow in a typical conversational way. Some questions were asked multiple times, and the answers have been condensed.]</p><p>Me: How you doing down there?</p><p>Tony: We had a big storm all weekend so I was trapped inside, it made me insane. At least today it’s not too windy and a balmy (1 below zero Fahrenheit).</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> So what’s your setup like?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> Well, we have three huts on the glacier and three huts out on islands, which we drive over sea ice to get to on a caravan-type thing on skis — that’s my favorite because you can take it anywhere.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Who else is there with you? What’s your room like?</p><p><strong>Tony: </strong>I live with 13 others. There are 12 men and two women [total]. Our house looks like a big red apartment block — it is a pretty big building, with a bar, pool tables, cinema, etc. I have my own room — just a single bed and a desk — [the] room is as wide as the bed is long — maybe 7-by-12 feet.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> What are most people down there for?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> Most people are here to maintain the station over winter, so [its] plumbers, sparkies [electricians] and mechanics. There’s also a doctor, a chef and [scientific] observers.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Is it hard to be away from friends and loved ones for a year?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> Yeah, it’s hard to be away, and most people talk to family a few times a week. It’s a bit like a space station — it’s windy and cold every day, so going outside requires a big cover-up and another big takeoff [of all the clothing] when you get to your work building. It’s a pain.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> What do you wear to go outside?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> In the field I put on thermals, then polar fleece and then a padded pair of pants and a big goose-down jacket. Then I put on a neck-warmer, a face mask like a bank robber and goggles and hat. Finally there are small finger gloves and a big pair of mitts with fluffy tops for wiping the snot off your face.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> What’s the coldest it’s gotten?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> We were on a trip when it was [minus 54 degrees F] — that was cold! Throwing a cup of hot water in the air makes it explode and turn to ice before it hits the ground.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> In winter is there any way out? Are you iced in?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> Yes, we are iced in as the sea ice has frozen. Also, with the light being so short and the [extreme] weather there are no flight options. We are all alone until November!</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> What is a typical day like down there?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> I use some of my day to do paperwork and get prepared for the field, and then a bit of gym. I take some naps, and then drink some beer. Yesterday I had a spa and gym — it’s not such a hard life. We should be able to walk on the sea ice pretty soon and it’ll be easier to play golf and fly kites.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Are you even allowed to drink booze? I heard it was banned at some stations.</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> Oh yes! We brew beer supplied by the division and we all sent down enough other types [of alcohol] to keep us happy — certainly enough for the odd sore [hangover] head. [More] alcohol is sent down on resupply paid for by expeditioners.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> What do you do for food? Do you eat penguin? If so, what does it taste like?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> We get food once per year at resupply, around February. There are a lot of frozen vegetables, and we have a small hydroponics building for some fresh greens and herbs. We get all of our supplies from the ship at resupply time, but this year the ship ran aground in a storm. We aren’t allowed to eat penguin, but it doesn’t look that good anyway.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> How often do food ships come in?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> Once per year on our station! So not a lot of fresh veggies now, but now we have a hydroponics set up [so it’s OK].</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> What do you do with your trash? Is there plumbing or a sewage system? Do you freeze your poop and ship it out?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> We ship all of our recycling and hard waste home. We have a waste-water treatment plant that breaks down and filters our waste water and poo and then puts the almost-pure water back into the sea. Any waste from the field, including poo, is already frozen, and we burn it all in a large incinerator in the kitchen.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> What do you do if you find yourself living with someone in close confines for a long period of time and they annoy the hell out of you? Have there been any fights?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> I just dream about hiding the body under the sea ice and try to imagine them as people with head injuries. [Author’s note: This is a joke]. There aren’t any fights — it’s pretty easy to avoid annoying people and most are fine. There is a long process before people are chosen to come here, especially for winter [and many are weeded out].</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Are you going bats--t stir-crazy?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> I was always crazy, but getting out in the field and exploring is great fun. Keeping busy is my biggest hurdle.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Speaking of which, do some people go [really] crazy?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> I wouldn’t say crazy, but there has definitely been some mood swings going on, and some people getting really quiet.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Is there a psychiatrist there?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> No, but we have one in Australia available (by phone) anytime.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> I heard there’s a straitjacket on base — have they ever had to use it? Is there a gun if someone goes completely mental?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> No straitjackets here, although we might end up needing one. No guns either.</p><p>[Author’s note: A friend who spent time on another unnamed base said there was a straitjacket at his station].</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> But you must get bored — what do you do?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> I do get bored, but we have a cinema so we can watch movies — we have millions of gigabytes of TV shows and movies. I like sci-fi and comedy movies — you can book to put a movie on in the cinema or watch TV and movies from your room off the server.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Do you guys have, like, robotic dogs for company?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> No, I wish. Although I’m looking into making a Chia Head today, just to have something to grow in my room and be a different color than white!</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Are you allowed to have visitors? Like if someone wanted to come say hi and found someone to take her there — would that be allowed?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> It is a government station, so there’s no tourism, although there are a few VIPs that come for short trips in summer.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> In lieu of entertainment, do people have sex a lot there? Like a “what happens on base stays on base kid of thing”?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> On other stations and in summer when there [are] more people, yes, they [have a lot of sex]. But not here.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> What’s the biggest misconception about living in Antarctica?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> That it’s dark all the time — we still get about three hours of light on the shortest day.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> If something serious goes wrong, what is the soonest rescue available?</p><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/06/tony-wild.jpg alt width=528 height=441 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> For us that would be in October I think, and we’d have to make an ice runway first. We have a pretty full-on medical suite here and can do most surgeries [such as for a burst appendix].</p><p>[Author’s note: Rescues do occur, however rarely. Recently, two people were flown out of Amundsen-Scott station due to unspecified illnesses. According to the Guardian, a midwinter rescue had been attempted there only twice before, “in 2001, when the base’s only physician came down with a potentially fatal case of pancreatitis; and once in 2003. Both airlifts were successful.” In 1999, Jerri Nielsen, a station’s doctor who had been treating herself for breast cancer was flown out in spring, when weather conditions are better.]</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> What do you miss the most?</p><p>Tony: I miss being able to walk outside and sit in the sun. I miss walking on grass and the smells and colors of the outside. This time of year there are no animals, so it is quite nice to see a bird fly past!</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> Will you do this job again?</p><p><strong>Tony:</strong> I will do it again, maybe in the summer when there is more deep- field work.</p><p>And a final word from Tony: “Went out and found the penguins the other day and today we are going for our midwinter swim! [28-degree] water and [minus -12.5] air [temperature] ... hope its nice and warm over there!”</p><p>It is, Tony ... it is.</p><p>This story was originally published on <a href=#>A Broad Abroad</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnd7j29mbGhfrLWiwIyiq6xlnJ64pnnTqGSloaaaeqq6jJqlrZmimMGqr8Bo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-its-like-to-live-in-antarctica.html&text=What%20its%20like%20to%20live%20in%20Antarctica&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-its-like-to-live-in-antarctica.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-its-like-to-live-in-antarctica.html&title=What%20its%20like%20to%20live%20in%20Antarctica" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-its-like-to-live-in-antarctica.html&title=What%20its%20like%20to%20live%20in%20Antarctica" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-its-like-to-live-in-antarctica.html&title=What%20its%20like%20to%20live%20in%20Antarctica" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-its-like-to-live-in-antarctica.html&description=What%20its%20like%20to%20live%20in%20Antarctica" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./francisca-lachapel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Francisca Lachapel?

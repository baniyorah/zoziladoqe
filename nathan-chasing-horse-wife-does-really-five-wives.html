Howbeit, the identities of these women remain undisclosed. It is reported that he forcefully took some of his wives. However, his 4th wife, a Tsuut’ina woman, was given to him as a gift by her mother when she was 14.</b></p><p>Nathan controlled his wives with the belief that he communicated with spirits, and told them that the police were a type of cult. As such, he trained them to shoot firearms for defense if the police ever tried to capture them. He also gave them suicide pills to take in case they were captured in order to keep their family.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content"><span class=ez-toc-js-icon-con><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></span></a></span><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Meet_the_5_Wives_of_Nathan_Chasing_Horse></span><strong>Meet the 5 Wives of Nathan Chasing Horse&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Even though the former actor, Nathan Chasing Horse is known for his penchant for privacy, we garnered that he was a husband to 5 women in North, Las Vegas. It’s not known if he was legally married to any of them as some of them were taken forcefully while others were given to him as gifts.</p><p>As such, information like the names of his wives and when they were taken is not known to the public. Out of his 5 wives, only one identified as a Tsuut’ina woman is known to the public. It is alleged that she was gifted to him by her mother who was a member of his circle when she was 14 years old. However, she became his fourth wife in 2009 at the age of 17 when she traveled to the U.S. to live with him.</p><p>According to the Tsuut’ina woman, she suffered physical abuse for several years and even endured a broken rib until she left in 2022. It was at this time she reported to the police and other woman and wives also shared their experiences including being forced into group s** and heartbreaking activities.</p><p>It is reported that he also forced his wives to have abortions under claims that the spirits would not let them bear his children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nathan_Chasing_Horse_Wives_Were_All_Trained_to_Shoot_Fire_Arms></span><b>Nathan Chasing Horse Wives Were All Trained to Shoot Fire Arms</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While the identities of Nathan’s wives remain undisclosed, we can assert that they shared knowledge of firearm shooting. Unfortunately, this skill was not to protect themselves from the sex… as they feared him but rather against police if at any point they tried to capture them.</p><p>It’s not known if they ever got to use their skills, however, Nathan also had a second plan if they were taken into custody. He instructed them to take pills and kill themselves so that their family would not be broken.</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Ike Turner Wives: Tina Turner And Other Women He Married</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nathans_Wives_Believed_that_he_Communicated_with_Spirits></span><strong>Nathan’s Wives Believed that he Communicated with Spirits</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Thinking of how Nathan lured these women?, we gathered that after his roles in movies such as Dances With Wolves and he became a medicine man. Nathan under the disguise of a medicine man, performed healing ceremonies where he would offer help and comfort to indigenous girls and women.</p><p>He gradually made them believe he communicated with some sort of higher beings and soon formed a cult. Most of his members were single women who had daughters and his victims were underage girls. Nathan would then use spiritual traditions and lure them to have s** with them. He also raped under-aged girls during his ceremonies.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Has_Nathan_Chasing_Horse_Been_Arrested></span><b>Has Nathan Chasing Horse Been Arrested?</b><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Yes, following several investigations by the Las Vegas police, the former actor, Nathan was arrested on January 31, 2023, and taken into custody. He is faced with at least 9 charges including s** trafficking, s*xual assault, and child abuse.</p><p>Investigators revealed that there have been several cases of his hideous acts which have been on record since the early 2000s. However, there was no sustaining evidence against him. As at this writing, at least 6 of his victims have shared that they were abused by him at the age of 14.</p><p>Amid this arrest, sources report that he was banishment from the Fort Peck Reservation in Poplar, Montana over 10 years ago. At the time, some allegations against him included human trafficking, drug dealing, spiritual abuse, and intimidation of tribal leaders.</p><p>Again, in 2015. reports say Fort Peck tribal leaders ban him from setting foot on the reservation. This was declared after a 7-0 vote.</p><p>Nathan awaits trial for his crimes as even more charges unfold in <a href=# rel=noopener>Alberta, Canada</a>. At that moment, he remains jailed in Las Vegas.</p><p><h3 class=jp-relatedposts-headline>Related</h3></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiipaCyo8HGrGWcp51ku6LAx5qlZpuYlsCqusZmn6iqo5p6uLXFnmSdp5WoerOxwKWjsmWWnsOmedairZ6rXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnathan-chasing-horse-wife-does-really-five-wives.html&text=Does%20He%20Really%20Have%20Five%20Wives&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnathan-chasing-horse-wife-does-really-five-wives.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnathan-chasing-horse-wife-does-really-five-wives.html&title=Does%20He%20Really%20Have%20Five%20Wives" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnathan-chasing-horse-wife-does-really-five-wives.html&title=Does%20He%20Really%20Have%20Five%20Wives" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnathan-chasing-horse-wife-does-really-five-wives.html&title=Does%20He%20Really%20Have%20Five%20Wives" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnathan-chasing-horse-wife-does-really-five-wives.html&description=Does%20He%20Really%20Have%20Five%20Wives" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./frederick-b-owens-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Frederick B.

They went on a honeymoon trip to Paris before his health began to decline with Diffuse Lewy Body Dementia, an illness they only learned he had after his death.</p><p class=Xg>The "Mrs. Doubtfire" star began to experience delusions, heightened anxiety levels, and restricted movement. Although he was able to get himself out there most of the time, his struggles would come out at home.</p><p class=Xg>Williams did everything he could to fight the illness. Even with the best care from doctors, his case was rare and debilitating. Schneider <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/robin-williams-personal-photos/>explained</a>:</p><p class=Xg>"What Robin had, it would be as if he had cancer in every organ of his body. His brain was so ravaged. The doctors said there was nothing more anyone could have done. It's one of the worst cases they've ever seen."</p><p class=Xg>The doting wife said that what kept Williams alive for so long was his heart. Although she was in agony for so long, time has made her learn to forgive her husband for taking his own life.</p><p class=Xg>They were each other's rock. Whenever they weren't together, they'd talk four to ten times a day. Whenever they were together, they'd do yoga on the beach with their friends, they'd meditate together, and whenever Williams had the energy to, they'd head out for dinner.</p><p class=Xg>Despite doing seemingly normal things, Williams was feeling melancholic through it all. <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/robin-williams-personal-photos/>According to Schneider,</a> the actor was "mad at himself for what his body was doing, for what his mind was doing."</p><p class=Xg>On August 11, 2014, Williams was found dead in the bathroom of his home. The night before, he suffered from paranoia, stocking several of his watches inside a sock before handing them to someone for safekeeping.</p><p class=Xg>As for his behavior, his wife said that he <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2829045/Robin-Williams-left-50-million-estate-three-kids-reveals-widow-Susan-gets-slice-fortune-couple-signed-prenup-marriage.html>seemed well</a> because he had taken his iPad out of the closet. She took it as a good sign because the actor had not watched TV or read the news in about half a year since then.</p><p class=Xg>The couple slept in separate bedrooms because Williams had trouble sleeping and would talk in his sleep. She last saw him at 10:30 p.m. before going to bed.</p><p class=Xg>When he was found, Schneider requested to see her husband's body. She prayed over him alongside the Sheriff's deputies before they took him away.</p><p class=Xg>Shortly after the actor's death, his children posted sweet messages remembering their dad on social media. His eldest son Zak said he not only lost his father, but his best friend.</p><p class=Xg>His only daughter Zelda revealed in her note that the last day they spent with him was during his birthday. "I will forever be grateful that my brothers and I got to spend that time alone with him, sharing gifts and laughter," she <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.etonline.com/news/149736_family_of_robin_williams_react_to_his_death>wrote</a>.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Zachary Williams and Robin Williams circa 1987. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Xg>His youngest, Cody, expressed how much love and respect he had for his dad.

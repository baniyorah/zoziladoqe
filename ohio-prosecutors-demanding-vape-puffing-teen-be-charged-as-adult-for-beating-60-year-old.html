So he should not be treated like the other individuals you see on the news wreaking havoc on the community.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">The teen told detectives that he thought he was in the middle of a dream during the attack. <span class=credit>Colerain Police Department</span></figure><p>But the Hamilton County DA wants the student tried as an adult for felony assault, a charge that would carry a far higher maximum sentence.</p><p>“No teacher should fear going to work on interacting with their students,” the agency said in a statement last month. “Currently, there is no evidence to suggest this was anything other than a vicious attack by the juvenile. It is fortunate that the victim is alive today. This is an incredibly serious matter and we intend to treat it as such.”</p><p>Grisly attacks on teachers at the hands of students have been on the rise across the country, with the beating of paraprofessional Joan Naydich in Florida the most prominent recent example.</p><p>Then 17-year-old Brendan Depa battered Naydich unconscious at Matanza High School in Flagler County last February after his Nintendo Switch was confiscated.</p><p><a href=#>Prosecutors successfully sought </a>to have the autistic teen tried as an adult, and a judge is expected to sentence him in the coming months. He is facing as little as probation and a maximum term of 30 years in prison.</p><p>Naydich has stated publicly that she wants him to face the top end of his term.</p><p>Prosecutors have been grappling with assault and murder cases stemming from drug-induced psychosis, with defense attorneys asserting that their clients are unable to comprehend their actions.</p><p><a href=#>A California woman</a> who fatally stabbed her boyfriend 108 times after taking a hit of potent marijuana from a bong was sentenced to probation last month.</p><p>Bryn Spejcher’s lawyers argued that she was technically “unconscious” at the time of the Ventura County murder was and thus unable to form an intent to kill.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmaW9fo7K4v46on6KnXaW%2FsL%2FEnKytp6KoeqWxzJqlnaGenHq3rc%2BeZKmtlpu2r7OMrZyepl2Xsm6vx5qpoJ2UYq60ecCdrKWsXZu8s3nBnpitoZ6cend8jLKcmqpdpLmlew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fohio-prosecutors-demanding-vape-puffing-teen-be-charged-as-adult-for-beating-60-year-old.html&text=Ohio%20prosecutors%20demanding%20vape-puffing%20teen%20be%20charged%20as%20adult%20for%20beating%2060-year-old&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fohio-prosecutors-demanding-vape-puffing-teen-be-charged-as-adult-for-beating-60-year-old.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fohio-prosecutors-demanding-vape-puffing-teen-be-charged-as-adult-for-beating-60-year-old.html&title=Ohio%20prosecutors%20demanding%20vape-puffing%20teen%20be%20charged%20as%20adult%20for%20beating%2060-year-old" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fohio-prosecutors-demanding-vape-puffing-teen-be-charged-as-adult-for-beating-60-year-old.html&title=Ohio%20prosecutors%20demanding%20vape-puffing%20teen%20be%20charged%20as%20adult%20for%20beating%2060-year-old" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fohio-prosecutors-demanding-vape-puffing-teen-be-charged-as-adult-for-beating-60-year-old.html&title=Ohio%20prosecutors%20demanding%20vape-puffing%20teen%20be%20charged%20as%20adult%20for%20beating%2060-year-old" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fohio-prosecutors-demanding-vape-puffing-teen-be-charged-as-adult-for-beating-60-year-old.html&description=Ohio%20prosecutors%20demanding%20vape-puffing%20teen%20be%20charged%20as%20adult%20for%20beating%2060-year-old" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sam-robards-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sam Robards Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./meg-white-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meg White  Bio (Wiki) ">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

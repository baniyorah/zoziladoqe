Rittenhouse, at the age of 17, was too young to legally purchase the weapon.</p><p>However, Thomas Binger, an assistant district attorney in Kenosha, stated in court that given Mr. Black’s willingness to cooperate in the case, he believed it was appropriate to dismiss the felony charges and imposed a $2,000 fine on him.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kyle_Rittenhouse_sister_Faith_and_McKenzie></span>Kyle Rittenhouse sister Faith and McKenzie <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Faith Rittenhouse</a> was born in August 2000, and she is Kyle and McKenzie Rittenhouse’s older sister. Faith was born in Antioch, Illinois, to a German and Irish family. She is Michael and Wendy Rittenhouse’s first child.</p><p>Faith Rittenhouse, now 22, was born in 2000, and McKenzie Rittenhouse, now 18, was born in December 2003.</p><p>McKenzie Rittenhouse, now 18 years old, was born in December 2003. McKenzie, on the other hand, came up during the trial because a man she was dating at the time admitted to buying the weapon for Rittenhouse. That man claimed he did not give the weapon to Rittenhouse because he was only 17, but the judge later dismissed the weapons charge due to state law wording.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kyle_Rittenhouse_arrest></span>Kyle Rittenhouse arrest<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, fatally shot two men and injured another in Kenosha, Wisconsin on August 25, 2020. The shootings occurred during the protests, riots, and civil unrest that followed a white police officer’s non-fatal shooting of a black man, Jacob Blake. Rittenhouse used the affirmative defense of self-defense during his trial and was acquitted of all charges.</p><p>Rittenhouse was carrying a semi-automatic, AR-15-style rifle and had joined a group of armed men in Kenosha who claimed to be there to protect businesses.</p><p>Unarmed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, of Kenosha, chased Rittenhouse into a parking lot and was fatally shot four times at close range. A crowd pursued Rittenhouse as he fled.</p><p>Anthony Huber, a 26-year-old Silver Lake resident, collided with Rittenhouse on his skateboard and was fatally shot in the chest by Rittenhouse.</p><p>Gaige Grosskreutz, a 26-year-old West Allis man armed with a handgun, was shot once in the right arm by Rittenhouse and survived.</p><p>Rittenhouse was charged with homicide, attempted homicide, reckless endangerment, unlawful possession of a firearm, and curfew violation.</p><p>His lawyer argued that his actions were in self-defense during his trial, which ran from November 1 to November 19, 2021. The charges of unlawful possession and curfew violation were dismissed by Judge Bruce Schroeder as legally unsupported, and a unanimous jury found Rittenhouse not guilty of the remaining charges.</p><p>The shootings polarized public opinion, and media coverage was both polarized and politicized. Some saw Kyle Rittenhouse as a hero, while others saw him as a criminal who deserved to be punished for his actions. However, his acquittal has sparked conflicting reactions; some celebrities saw the court ruling as unfair, while others believe it was the right thing to do.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kyle_Rittenhouse_parents></span>Kyle Rittenhouse parents<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Wendy Rittenhouse is Kyle Rittenhouse’s mother. She has frequently defended her son in interviews and was a constant presence during her son’s jury trial, breaking down in tears during his testimony.</p><p>She was photographed with members of the Proud Boys organization in a Wisconsin bar, but his attorneys claim he is not a member of that organization.</p><p>Wendy Rittenhouse told those who criticize her son that he is not a monster and that they should watch the incident video. And they must take it one step at a time. He didn’t, he did nothing wrong. She claimed that a mob attacked her son. “From the first to the second and third.”</p><p>The last text I sent Kyle was, ‘Where are you at? Are you okay?’ He said, ‘Yes, I am okay. Doing medic.’ That was at like 11:30 and then I fell asleep,” his mother said. “Then I jolted out of my sleep and knew something was wrong. I knew I had to go find him.”</p><p>Wendy Rittenhouse, on the other hand, has chastised the police for failing to do their job in favor of a 17-year-old boy assisting. The police should have assisted these people who had lost their businesses. “They should have taken the initiative,” Wendy said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kyle_Rittenhouse%E2%80%99s_Net_Worth></span>Kyle Rittenhouse’s Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kyle Rittenhouse’s net worth is currently unknown, but according to UsaToday, he will receive a portion of his $2 million bails and will retain nearly $1 million of the crowd-funded bail that was posted to keep him out of jail during his homicide trial last year. However, new charges filed against him may prevent him from profiting from it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Kyle_Rittenhouse_Background></span>Kyle Rittenhouse Background<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kyle Howard Rittenhouse was born in Antioch, Illinois, on January 3, 2003, to Michael and Wendy Rittenhouse. He is white and American. Rittenhouse’s parents married in Lake County, Illinois, in February 2000, and his older sister was born in August of that year. In December 2003, his younger sister was born. By 2014, his parents had divorced.</p><p>Rittenhouse joined the Grayslake Police Department’s Explorers program as a high school freshman, as well as the Antioch Fire Department’s cadet program, with the goal of becoming a paramedic or working in law enforcement. He eventually dropped out and left Lakes Community High School altogether in 2018, after attending for one semester in 2017-2018.</p><p>Through publicly viewable social media posts, he expressed interest in law enforcement. Rittenhouse launched a Facebook fundraiser for the nonprofit Humanizing the Badge in December 2018.</p><p>Other posts focused on “honoring police with Blue Lives Matter graphics, photos of officers killed in the line of duty, and the “thin blue line” flag associated with law enforcement support.” Rittenhouse had written “BLUE LIVES MATTER” and “Trump 2020” in his TikTok profile description.</p><p>Rittenhouse sat in the front row of a Donald Trump rally in Des Moines, Iowa on January 30, 2020. Rittenhouse documented his ordeal on the social media platform TikTok, which he later removed.</p><p>Rittenhouse took a part-time job as a lifeguard at the Lindenhurst YMCA, but was laid off in March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimkZ63or%2FUqZyrnpGjwG%2BvzqZmsKCfYra0ecqyo55lop7BtbHNoaauq5ViwKq%2F056pZqCVp7JutdJmmKWkXa68tnnNnpydZaSkeqy6zrBkoqZdZ31zfo4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-kyle-rittenhouse-sister-here-is-all-you-need-to-know-in-2022.html&text=Who%20is%20Kyle%20Rittenhouse%20Sister%3f%20Here%20is%20all%20you%20need%20to%20know%20in%202022&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-kyle-rittenhouse-sister-here-is-all-you-need-to-know-in-2022.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-kyle-rittenhouse-sister-here-is-all-you-need-to-know-in-2022.html&title=Who%20is%20Kyle%20Rittenhouse%20Sister%3f%20Here%20is%20all%20you%20need%20to%20know%20in%202022" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-kyle-rittenhouse-sister-here-is-all-you-need-to-know-in-2022.html&title=Who%20is%20Kyle%20Rittenhouse%20Sister%3f%20Here%20is%20all%20you%20need%20to%20know%20in%202022" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-kyle-rittenhouse-sister-here-is-all-you-need-to-know-in-2022.html&title=Who%20is%20Kyle%20Rittenhouse%20Sister%3f%20Here%20is%20all%20you%20need%20to%20know%20in%202022" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-kyle-rittenhouse-sister-here-is-all-you-need-to-know-in-2022.html&description=Who%20is%20Kyle%20Rittenhouse%20Sister%3f%20Here%20is%20all%20you%20need%20to%20know%20in%202022" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./barbie-virgin-mary-and-jesus-ken-creators-receive-death-threats.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Barbie Virgin Mary' and 'Jesus Ken' creators receive death threats">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./chase-stokes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is American Actor, Chase Stokes Dating?

On September 6, 2015, McCabe went to a <strong>club called Povlitzki’s</strong> on 65 in Spring Lake Park, Minnesota, along with two friends. One of those friends was <strong>William “Papus” Kennedy.</strong></p><p>By all accounts, the three men drank and socialized like normal at the club that night. At some point, McCabe gave his wallet to one friend for safekeeping. Later, Kennedy took McCabe’s car keys, claiming he didn’t want him driving while intoxicated.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading jtoc-heading" id=timeline-of-events-that-night>Timeline of Events That Night</h3><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tr><th>Time</th><th>Event</th></tr><tbody readability=2><tr readability=2><td>Night of Sept 6-7</td><td>McCabe goes to club with Kennedy and other friend</td></tr><tr><td>2 AM</td><td>The three leave the club</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>After 2 AM</td><td>Kennedy claims he dropped McCabe off at a gas station</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>After leaving the club around 2 AM, Kennedy claims he dropped McCabe off at a gas station to get <a href=# title="Carlee Russell Safely Returns Home Following Mysterious Two-Day Disappearance" rel=noopener>home safely</a> rather than driving him all the way home.</p><p>Initial confusion surrounded exactly where Kennedy left McCabe. Kennedy first claimed it was a <strong>Super America station in Fridley</strong>, but surveillance footage later showed it was actually a <strong>Holiday gas station in Spring Lake Park.</strong></p><p>It remains unclear why Kennedy would drop McCabe off alone at a gas station in the middle of the night instead of taking him home. This discrepancy has led some to be suspicious of Kennedy’s story.</p><p>What is clear is that this was the last confirmed sighting of McCabe. By the next morning when <strong>McCabe didn’t show up</strong> to work, his shocking <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">disappearance</a> was underway – and all that was left behind was a disturbing voicemail message.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading jtoc-heading" id=the-voicemail-of-henry-mccabe><span>The Voicemail of Henry McCabe</span></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The most perplexing piece of evidence in <strong>Henry McCabe’s disappearance</strong> is the disturbing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">voicemail message</a> left on his wife Kareen’s phone in the early hours of September 7, 2015.</p><p>Kareen was in California when at 2:28 AM, she received a voicemail from her husband’s phone number that contained two minutes of <strong>bizarre noises and sounds</strong>.</p><h3 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading jtoc-heading" id=details-about-the-voicemail>Details About the Voicemail</h3><ul><li>Last time Kareen heard Henry’s voice</li><li>Contains odd grunting, growling noises</li><li>Possible <strong>moans and cries of pain</strong></li><li>McCabe seems to say “Stop it” at the end</li><li>Voicemail pinged off a cell tower near Creekview Park</li></ul><p>The full voicemail recording has not been publicly released, but snippets shared by news outlets reveal troubling sounds of a man potentially in severe distress.</p><p>Some claim to hear McCabe saying he has been shot, along with hearing the name “Papus” on the recording – William Kennedy’s nickname. However, the FBI analyzed the voicemail but apparently found no concrete clues as to what was transpiring.</p><p>The contents remain bizarre and unexplained to this day. If it was McCabe on the recording, what or who was inflicting such pain and anguish? Why would these be his last recorded moments before he disappeared forever?</p><p>For investigators and McCabe’s family, the voicemail represents the biggest piece of the puzzle that doesn’t fit.

He didn’t deserve to die. Someone did this to him. There is a God and he knows what happened and hates an injustice. Whoever did this, God will deal with you,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said Kareen.</a></p><p>According to <strong>David Singleton</strong>, the chief executive of Minnesota Community Policing, he holds the belief that McCabe’s demise was not a mere accident, and furthermore, he asserts that McCabe was not alone on that fateful night.</p><p>“I don’t believe that he just wandered that far on his own and the audio doesn’t support the idea that his death is not suspicious,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he stated</a>.</p><p>Some in the local Liberian immigrant community have suggested McCabe may have been <strong>killed in some kind of ritualistic way</strong> linked to his home country. However, no concrete evidence points to this.</p><p>There have been a few <strong>suspicions surrounding McCabe’s wife, Kareen,</strong> as she was out of town on the night in question. Some reports indicated that Kareen had suspicions of McCabe’s infidelity, which could be seen as a possible motive for murder.</p><p>However, it is important to note that there is no direct evidence implicating her in any foul play. According to multiple sources, Kareen was in California at the time of McCabe’s death.</p><p>It is plausible that she may have either hired someone or convinced someone to carry out the act, but her direct involvement in the murder is yet to be established.</p><p><strong>Suicide</strong> is considered doubtful by most who knew McCabe, since he had no known reason to take his own life. He seemed happy with his wife, kids, and job.</p><p>That leaves <strong>accident</strong> as a plausible explanation – that an intoxicated McCabe wandered into the lake and drowned. But this still fails to account for the panicked voicemail message and other odd details.</p><p>With such limited evidence available, McCabe’s loved ones may never get a satisfactory, definitive explanation for what transpired that night. Each theory has holes, and the full truth about his fate may forever remain a mystery.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading joli-heading jtoc-heading" id=ongoing-questions-and-theories><span>Ongoing Questions and Theories</span></h2><p>Years later, the bizarre <a href=# title="Amber Tuccaro Disappearance & Death Mystery – She Captured Her Killer’s Voice" rel=noopener>disappearance and death</a> of Henry McCabe remains shrouded in mystery, with more questions than answers.

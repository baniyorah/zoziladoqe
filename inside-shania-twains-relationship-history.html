Throughout her decades-spanning career, Twain has garnered a trove of esteemed accolades, including a few Grammys, multiple ACM awards, and more, making her one of the most decorated female country singers. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on August 28, 1965, in Windsor, Canada, Twain has not only blurred the line between country and pop, which garnered her title of Queen of Country Pop but has also branched her repertoire in other areas of showbiz. Also, an actress, Twain's credits include <i>I Heart Huckabees, Trading Paint</i>, and <i>I Still Believe.</i> &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Shania Twain's Relationship History! &nbsp;</h3><p>Throughout the course of her illustrious career, Twain has stolen the limelight a number of times, once, because of her unconventional, and eyebrow-raising relationship. The Canadian singer's relationship history, however, doesn't reveal a lot of men. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/26/354241594_1001288601044278_4693127950805625938_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687800538063.jpg><p>In fact, since catapulting to stardom, Shania has only ever been with two men, one of them being her ex-husband, and another one being her now-husband. The Grammy-winning crooner first met her then-future-husband, <strong>Robert John "Mutt" Lange,</strong> a record producer, when she was yet to be discovered like the powerhouse she is now. &nbsp;</p><p>Robert, 74, was then working with AC/DC and <strong>Def Leppard</strong>, and was on board to produce Twain's next album. The duo got closer after their planned meeting at Nashville's Fan Fair in June 1993 and soon started a hasty romance, which would later end with one of the biggest scandals. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/26/294051334_1399706100536289_500322802971932115_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687800545871.jpg><p>After a few months of thrilling romance, Twain and the 17-year older record producer tied the knot in December 1993. During their 17-year-long nuptial, from 1993 to 2010, the duo welcomed one child and grew a joint brand to become one of the best-recognized power couples in the country industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Shania's relatively low-key marriage was at the forefront of many gossip tabloids after the pair announced their split in 2008. But things were more twisted than they look. The<i> Party For Two</i> hitmaker had apparently learned about her husband's affair with her then-best friend, <a href=#>Marie-Anne</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>And while both Robert and Anne vehemently denied the accusations, the truth came to the surface in due time. Like fans weren't hard enough by Twain and Mutt's sudden split and the producer's illicit romance, more surprises followed after Shania was linked with Anne's husband at the time,<strong> Frédéric Thiébaud</strong>. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Shania's first husband, Robert Lange, cheated on her with her then-best friend, Marie-Anne!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>The <i>Ka-Ching </i>hitmaker later revealed that while she was enduring her "embarrassing" split from Robert, she befriended Thiébaud, who was living the same heartbreak. The complicated relationship is still remembered as one of the most scandalous cases of husband swapping in the music industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Shania Twain has been Married for Over a Decade! &nbsp;</h3><p>Twain and Robert's publicized fallout was a humiliating experience for the singer. Earlier this year, the Canadian star<a href=#> revealed </a>that she still doesn't talk with her ex, who went on to live with Marie in Switzerland. Her fateful romance with her now-husband, Thiébaud, was probably the only good thing that came out of her divorce. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/26/351460867_982058293231923_5088967918850787502_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687800560231.jpg><p>Shania and Fredrick had known each other before their conjugal lives took an infamous turn. But it was only during their unraveling marriage with their then-partners that the two developed a deep friendship. The couple confirmed their engagement in late 2010 and walked <a href=#>down the aisle</a> on January 1, 2010. &nbsp;</p><p>The otherwise reticent Twain has since gushed about her marriage several times. "We were a support to each other — and really found something beautiful in the end and unexpected," the Grammy winner said of her relationship with Fredrick. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/26/90428595_223398788904035_7480960042481321568_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687800588795.jpg><p>The <i>Any of Man of Mine</i> hitmaker has even gone to hail Fredrick as her lifeline. "I cannot live without him," Shania once said. She added, "I just need what we have. It grounds me every day and reminds me that there are a lot of important things going on in the world." Despite being married for over a decade, Shania and her husband are yet to welcome a child of their own. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/6/26/317920072_1907509956264365_2564340938444061226_n%20(1)%20(1)-1687800570165.jpg><p>The pair are stepparents to each other's kids from their first marriage. While Shania co-parents her son, <strong>Eja</strong>, with Robert, Fredrick is also looking after a daughter,<strong> Johanna, </strong>who he shares with Anna. Not much is known about Shania's husband, Fredrick, except for the fact that he is a businessman, and is very supportive of his wife's sky-high career. &nbsp;</p><p>Most of Fredrick's Instagram posts are either about or for Shania. Twain's recent Netflix documentary, <i>Not Just a Girl</i>, looks back on her impressive journey, which also includes her first infamous marriage and her thriving nuptial with Fredrick.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnq0tMCnoJplpKyuqrrSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWYnsC1u9Gy</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2finside-shania-twains-relationship-history.html&text=Inside%20Shania%20Twain%27s%20Relationship%20History&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2finside-shania-twains-relationship-history.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2finside-shania-twains-relationship-history.html&title=Inside%20Shania%20Twain%27s%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2finside-shania-twains-relationship-history.html&title=Inside%20Shania%20Twain%27s%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2finside-shania-twains-relationship-history.html&title=Inside%20Shania%20Twain%27s%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2finside-shania-twains-relationship-history.html&description=Inside%20Shania%20Twain%27s%20Relationship%20History" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./heather-rae-young.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is An American Actress, Heather Rae Young Dating Or Single?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./284943-dying-rich-man-hears-his-5-children-figh-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dying Rich Man Hears His 5 Children Fighting over His Inheritance  Story of the Day">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
